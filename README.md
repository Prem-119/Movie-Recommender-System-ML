# Movie-Recommender-System-ML

Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) vectorization and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this system is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie features.

Features
Utilizes SVM for vectorization: Support Vector Machine is employed to vectorize movie features and user preferences, providing a mathematical representation of the relationships between movies and users.

Incorporates NLP for text analysis: Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to analyze movie descriptions, reviews, and user feedback to extract meaningful features for recommendation.

Personalized recommendations: The system tailors recommendations to individual users by considering their past interactions, ratings, and preferences, ensuring a personalized and relevant movie list.

Dataset
The system is trained and tested on a comprehensive movie dataset containing information such as movie titles, descriptions, genres, ratings, and user interactions. This dataset is crucial for training the recommendation model and evaluating its performance.

Implementation
The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn for SVM implementation, NLTK for NLP tasks, and pandas for data manipulation. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and recommendation generation.

Usage
To use the movie recommendation system:
Run the app.py script to load the dataset, train the recommendation model, and generate personalized movie recommendations.
Interact with the system by providing user feedback, ratings, or preferences to refine future recommendations.
